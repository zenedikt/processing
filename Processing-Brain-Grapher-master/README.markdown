##Processing Brain Grapher

####Overview
This is a simple Processing application for graphing changes in brain waves over time. It's designed to read data from a MindWave Mobile EEG headset connected via Bluetooth. 

It's mostly a proof of concept, demonstrating how to parse serial packets from the Arduino Brain Library, monitor signal strength, etc.

`brain_grapher.pde` is the main project file. Open this in the Processing PDE to work with the project.


Cloned from: https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Processing-Brain-Grapher 
and ported for use with MindWave Mobile.
